Please follow the steps below:

### Steps:
1. This instruction can be found on line 15 of the Main.java file. What will you use to make one int variable the same as another int variable? Create an int variable called copy and make it equal to the int variable original.
2. This instruction can be found on line 24 of the Main.java file. Now using the == operator to create an if statement to check if the following two ints are equal. In the if statement print out "They are equal".
3. In the if statement print out "They are equal". Replace comments in the below block of code (Note: Be sure to remove /** **/ as that is the symbol for multiline comments).
4. This instruction can be found on line 35 of the Main.java file. Create statement that compares the two strings using the == operator.
5. This instruction can be found on line 39 of the Main.java file. Now try using the string method .equals() for the same task as above.


### Test:
Use the test provided. This test accounts for all the print statements already in the file.

#### Sample output:
```
