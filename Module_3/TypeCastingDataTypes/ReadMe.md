## Type Casting Data Types
### Description:
This activity will help you understand how casting data types works in Java. Mary initially has $6.50 as a float value. However She deposits it into a bank and the bank can only handle integer values. The bank now registers only $6. The 50 cents have disappeared.
Please follow the steps below:

### Steps:
1. Read the code in Main.java and see how Mary's 50 cents have vanished.
2. Find this instruction on line 17 in Main.java:
4. Try adding an integer value to a float value.
5. You don't need to do the casting yourself because the float value is larger and the conversion from int to float happens automatically!
6. Use an integer of 10 and a float of 3.755.
7. Add them and print the result. 

### Test:
Use the test provided. The test accounts for the print outs from Mary's case.

#### Sample output:
```
Mary started with: 6.5. 
This is the amount the bank registered: 6
13.755
```
